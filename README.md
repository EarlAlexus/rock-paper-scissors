# Project: Rock Paper Scissors
A web-based Rock Paper Scissors game where players compete against the computer. Initially played via the browser console, this project will later include a fully styled graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience. The game is played over 5 rounds, with scores tracked for both the player and the computer, and a winner declared at the end.

## Features
- **Random Computer Choice:** The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors each round.
- **Player Input:** Initially, the player inputs their choice using a prompt in the console. A GUI will be added later for interactive gameplay.
- **Score Tracking:** The game tracks scores for both the player and the computer across 5 rounds.
- **Round-based Play:** The game consists of 5 rounds, with a final winner based on the accumulated scores.
- **Upcoming GUI:** Future updates will include a styled interface with buttons for player choices and visual feedback on game results.
